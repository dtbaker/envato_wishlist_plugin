# Wizvato

Wizvato is a JavaScript app that helps buyers find items on the Envato Market.

## Standalone

Please see `wishlist.html` for a standalone example ( demo here: http://dtbaker.github.io/wizvato/wishlist.html )
All data is saved in the users browser.
There are no backend PHP scripts so it is very quick to return details from the Envato API.

## WordPress Plugin

Please see http://dtbaker.net/wizvato-preview/ for a demo of what it looks like in WordPress (not as nice as standalone)
Simply install this as a WordPress plugin and use the [wizvato] shortcode on a page.
All data is saved in the users browser.
There are no backend PHP scripts (besides the one to render the initial WordPress shortcode content) so it is very quick to return details from the Envato API.
To style this nicer please copy the `css/wizvato.css` and `templates/wizvato_shortcode.php` into your WordPress Theme Folder and edit them there.
