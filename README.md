# Wizvato

Wizvato is a standalone JavaScript HTML app that helps buyers find items on the Envato Market.

Please see `wishlist.html` for a standalone example ( demo here: http://dtbaker.github.io/wizvato/wishlist.html )

This can also be installed as a WordPress plugin and simply use the [wizvato] shortcode to output the app on a page.
